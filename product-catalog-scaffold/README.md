# Product Catalog Service - DECODE SOLUTIONS 

This scaffold contains a minimal but complete starting point for the Product Catalog microservice.

Features included:
- Spring Boot (REST + GraphQL)
- Flyway migrations
- Lombok
- MapStruct mapper
- Redis caching (annotations)
- Kafka event publisher
- Tenant filter (X-Client-ID)
- OpenAPI (springdoc)
- Dockerfile + docker-compose for local dev (Postgres, Redis, Redpanda)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow

Next steps: implement repository queries for GraphQL search, add contract tests and more resolvers.
